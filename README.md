ðŸ“„ Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset.
The objective is to extract meaningful insights using statistical and visual techniques.

ðŸ“Š Tasks Performed
Loaded and explored the dataset (train.csv from Kaggle).

Checked for missing values and data types.

Analyzed value distributions for each column.

Conducted:

Univariate Analysis (histograms, count plots)

Bivariate Analysis (relationships between variables like Gender vs Survival, Class vs Survival)

Multivariate Analysis (correlation heatmap, pairplots)

Made observations and summarized key findings.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

Passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) survived more than those in lower classes.

Fare and Age showed some correlation with survival chances.

Missing values were observed mainly in the Age and Cabin columns.
